# Udacity Project 2: Pipelines and Deployment

This objective of this project was to learn how to use Azure ML Studio to deploy and consume both autoML pipelines and stand-alone models. Swagger and Apache Benchmark were other technologies that were utilized for this project to both aid in documentation of the endpoint and testing the endpoint's capabilities in responding to user requests respectively.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.
